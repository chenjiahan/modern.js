# General Questions

## What is the relationship between Modern.js Module and Rsbuild?

Modern.js Module uses esbuild to build toolkits and component libraries, and Rsbuild focuses on solving web application building scenarios.

## Can Modern.js Module use webpack plugins or loaders?

Modern.js Module is based on esbuild for building and cannot use tools from the webpack-related ecosystem.

To allow reuse of the webpack and Rspack ecosystems, we have developed Rslib, which is the next generation library development tools that will provide better build performance and plugin ecosystem. You can refer to the [Rslib repository](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rslib) for more information.
